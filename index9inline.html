<p1>The Indian national flag,
     also known as the Tiranga 
     (meaning "three colours")
     , is a horizontal tricolor with 
     India saffron (Kesari) at the top,
      white in the middle, and India green at the bottom.
       In the center of the white band is a navy-blue wheel with 24 spokes, called the Ashoka Chakra. The flag's design was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India on July 22, 1947. </p1>
